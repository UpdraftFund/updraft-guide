You can edit a Solution you drafted from its page to provide news to your funders or to extend a goal after it's been reached.

## Providing news

Use the "news" field of the edit form to let funders know about your progress. They will see the update on their home page in the "Updates" section.

## Extending a goal

If your solution reaches its goal, you have the opportunity to extend the goal and the deadline.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you extend a goal:

* all previously contributed funds will automatically be withdrawn to your wallet.
* all funders' positions will remain intact and can continue to earn üéÅ funder rewards, but contributions made before the goal was extended will no longer be refundable.
