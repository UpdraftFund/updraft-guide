Campaigns direct attention toward a theme or topic by committing funds to reward participants through _airdrops_ and funding solutions.

## Tasks Section

Campaigns are visible in the Tasks section of the home page. They are ordered by the value of the committed funds.

## Creating a Campaign

Start in the [campaigns channel of the Updraft discord](https://discord.gg/w8At3Vd74K) to fill the form to create a campaign.

Information you can include:

* Campaign name
* Description
* Image
* Link that provides more information for participants
* Committed funds.
  * Which tokens besides UPD are you including in your committed funds? Committing funds in a community token are a great way to encourage drafters to accept funding in that token.
  * Which wallet addresses will distribute the funds?
* Tag combination
  * What tag combination should people apply to their Ideas and Solutions to take part in the campaign? â€” For example, a campaign to build reputation solutions for Aura, might use "aura" and "reputation" as its tags.

## Finding Ideas and Solutions related to a Campaign

Clicking the action button on the Campaign leads to the "search by tags" results for the tag combination used by the Campaign.

Ideas using your tag combination are ordered by ðŸ”¥, which signifies community interest.

## Campaign Ideas

When creating an Idea, there's an option for creators to join your campaign by using its tags.

## Applying Committed Funds

### Airdrops

Airdrops are one of the two main ways to use committed funds to reward participants for showing interest in your campaign.

On an Idea page, just below the "Support Idea" button is a checkbox for "Airdrop". By using this checkbox, you airdrop the entire amount of your transaction to past supporters of this Idea.

Like other Idea funding, airdrops are done using UPD.

### Funding Solutions

Idea pages list Solutions that have been proposed for that Idea. Each Solution represents a concrete proposal to implement the Idea.

You should use your committed funds to fund high quality Solutions that are nearing their funding deadline.
