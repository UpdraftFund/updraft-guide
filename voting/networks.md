# Networks

By creating or supporting Ideas with the tags \[updraft] \[vote] and \[networks], you're voting to decide which networks will&#x20;

* Have support in Updraft. People will be able to perform functions using supported networks and see combined results from them.
* Have liquidity pools for the Updraft token (UPD).

## Rules

### Eligibility

Ideas using the tags \[updraft] \[vote] and \[network] will be counted in the vote.

### Counting

The ðŸ”¥interest for each choice will be recorded at the end of the voting period. Interest from Ideas clearly representing the same choice will be combined.

### Voting period

Voting will start with the deployment of the Updraft smart contracts on Arbitrum and will end when Updraft Idea and Solution contracts have a combined TVL of $10M worth of UPD for 10 straight days.

### Results

Any network with over 10% of the total ðŸ”¥interest in Ideas with the \[updraft] \[vote] and \[networks] tags will be supported in the Updraft App.

The winning networks will have UPD liquidity pools deployed on them. The amount of UPD deployed on a network will be proportional to the ðŸ”¥interest it received.
