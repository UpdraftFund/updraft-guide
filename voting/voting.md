# 🗳️ Voting

Ideas on Updraft can be used as choices and receive votes.

Voting can be accomplished as follows.

1. Anyone can organize a vote by designating a combination of tags to be used in Ideas, for example \[updraft] \[vote] \[networks].
2. People create Ideas using those tags.
3. Other people support those Ideas.
4. The winning choice is the Idea with the most 🔥at the end of the voting period.

An advantage of voting this way is that early voters can be paid by later voters via 🎁 funder rewards.
