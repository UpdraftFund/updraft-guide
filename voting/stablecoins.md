# Stablecoins

By creating or supporting Ideas with the tags \[updraft] \[vote] and \[stablecoins], you're voting to decide which stablecoins will be:

* Included in the funding token dropdown list in the "Create Solution" page.
* Paired with UPD in liquidity pools deployed on supported networks.

## Rules

### Eligibility

Ideas using the tags \[updraft] \[vote] and \[stablecoins] will be counted in the vote.

### Counting

The ðŸ”¥interest for each choice will be recorded at the end of the voting period. Interest from Ideas clearly representing the same choice will be combined.

### Voting period

Voting will start with the deployment of the Updraft smart contracts on Arbitrum and will end when Updraft Idea and Solution contracts have a combined TVL of $10M worth of UPD for 10 straight days.

### Results

Any stablecoin with over 10% of the total ðŸ”¥interest in Ideas with the \[updraft] \[vote] and \[stablecoins] tags will be supported in the Updraft App.

The winning stablecoins will be included in the "Create Solution" token dropdown in order of ðŸ”¥interest.

The winning stablecoins will be paired with UPD in at least one liquidity pool. The amounts paired will be proportional to the ðŸ”¥interest each choice received.
