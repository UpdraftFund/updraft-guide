# ✅ Supporting an Idea

When you support an Idea, you show that you would like to see it implemented. You raise awareness for it by your support. The Idea's interest 🔥 increases, which make it more visible to other people, and more likely that people will draft Solutions for it.

You also have the potential to earn funder rewards for creating or supporting an Idea.

## Positions

Each time you support an Idea, you create a position in that Idea.

When you withdraw from a position, you receive your original contribution, minus any funder reward and anti-spam fees you paid, plus any amount you earned from fees.

{% hint style="info" %}
The default Funding Reward for Ideas is 5%. The anti-spam fee is typically 1%.
{% endhint %}

### Multiple positions

Because the earning potential of a position increases over time, when you add more support, you create another position. Each position must be withdrawn separately.
