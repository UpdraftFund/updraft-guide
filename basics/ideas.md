# ðŸ’¡ Ideas

## Ideas

Everything in Updraft starts with an Idea. It can be an idea to make your neighborhood better or improve the project you're working on. You can go as big or as small as you like with your Idea.&#x20;

### Finding Ideas

On Updraft, you will see a lot of Ideas from other people. You can search for them by text or by tags, and you can "watch" tags to save them for future searches.

### ðŸ”¥ Interest

As people support Ideas, they grow in ðŸ”¥interest, which makes them easier to find.

After you get a wallet and fund it with UPD, you'll be able to support Ideas.
