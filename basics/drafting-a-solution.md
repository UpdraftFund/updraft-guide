# ðŸ“ƒ Drafting a Solution

Once you have a concrete plan to implement an Idea, you can draft a Solution from an Idea page.

You may already have a Solution in mind when you create an Idea. It's perfectly fine to draft a Solution to your own Idea.

## Questions to answer

When drafting a Solution, you'll need to answer the following questions.

* How much funding do you need?

You can raise a small amount to accomplish the first milestone of your Solution and then extend the funding goal and deadline.

* What token do you want people to fund with? (The default is UPD.)

Choose a token that will be convenient for funders. Everyone on Updraft will already have UPD tokens. You can also choose a token with a stable value (a stablecoin) to make sure the goal amount doesn't change value during the fundraising period.

* How much time do you need to raise the required funds?

Shorter deadlines are attractive to funders because they know they can get a refund sooner if the goal fails.

* How many tokens should you stake?

A stake is an optional way to increase the chance of funding by offering an additional reward if the goal isn't met.
