# ðŸ“ƒ Drafting a Solution

If you have a concrete plan to implement an Idea, you should draft a Solution from its Idea page.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may have a Solution in mind when you create an Idea. It's perfectly fine to draft the first Solution to your own Idea.
{% endhint %}

Before you draft a Solution, you should decide the following:

* How much funding do you need?

{% hint style="info" %}
You can raise a small amount to accomplish the first milestone of your Solution and then extend the funding goal and deadline.
{% endhint %}

* What token do you want people to send to your Solution fund? (The default is UPD.)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Choose a token that will be convenient for funders.
{% endhint %}
