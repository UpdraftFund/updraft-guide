# Using a wallet

## What is a wallet?

A wallet is a source of funds secured by a passphrase, but it's also much more than that.

Every public action taken on Updraft is done using a wallet.

Creating Ideas, drafting Solutions, supporting other people's Ideas and Solutions, editing your public profile and sharing updates are all done with a wallet.

## Choosing a wallet

When you click on the "Connect Wallet" button in Updraft, you'll be greeted by a selection of 50 wallets. They have been vetted by [WalletConnect's WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/), so you're safe to try any of them. If you don't like a wallet after trying it, you can transfer your account to a different wallet. I've chosen three wallets that I use regularly and placed them at the top of the list.

## Funding and using a wallet

If you need help funding and using your wallet, please visit our [chat server (Discord)](https://discord.gg/2fTMceFmns). Members will help you get the tokens you need--especially UPD, which is used for most actions in Updraft.

### Fees

{% hint style="info" %}
Every action with a wallet requires at least one fee. You will typically see a popup from your wallet, asking you to authorize these fees. (Many are truly tiny--a fraction of a cent.)
{% endhint %}

#### Anti-spam fees

Most actions have a small fee, paid in UPD. All of these fees go to a pool that is paid to Updraft users who need a little UPD to try Updraft. You can currently collect a small amount of UPD from our Discord server.

As the name suggests, anti-spam fees also help prevent Updraft from being overrun by spam.

#### Funding rewards

Some actions may incur a "Funding reward" fee, which is paid to previous contributors for discovering good Ideas and Solutions early.
