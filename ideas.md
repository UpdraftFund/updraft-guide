# 💡 Ideas

## Ideas

Everything in Updraft starts with an Idea. It can be an idea to make your neighborhood better or improve a product or business. You can go as big or as small as you like with your idea.&#x20;

### Finding Ideas

On Updraft, you will see a lot of Ideas from other people. You can search for them by text or by tags, and you can "watch" tags to save them for future searches.

### Interest 🔥

As people support Ideas, they grow in interest (🔥) , which makes them easier to find.

Next, we'll talk about how to get a wallet and fund it with UPD, which is the token you'll use to support Ideas.
